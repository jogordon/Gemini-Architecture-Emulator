Directions for running an assembly file:

To run the program "test1.s" do the following:

In line 55 of Form1.cs edit the argument for the ReadBinary() method to "test1.out".
In line 132 of IPE.cs, edit the argument for the filestream constructor to "test1.out"

The run the application and use the load button to load test1.s.

To run other assembly files use the same method, but obviously to run test2.s you would use test2.out instead of test1.out.

.out files are saved to the same directory as the executable (debug)
